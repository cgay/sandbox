## Open Dylan TODO List

My personal idea of a prioritized list of projects that need to be
completed in order for Open Dylan to be "ready for prime time".

1.  Trivial installation
    1.  sudo apt-get install dylan
    1.  sudo brew install dylan
    1.  etc
1.  package manager
    1.  Design document
    1.	Server-side infrastructure
    1.  Implement get, list, remove, update. Still using LID files at this point.
    1.  Compiler integration -- the "build" and "test" commands -- one-shot conversion or migration from LID to packages?
    1.  Move libraries to their own git repositories
1.  Fix scary warnings -- how important?
1.  Fix test suites -- how important?
1.  Fix ref docs to link back to main website.
1.  Readable backtraces in terminal when app crashes.
1.  Important libraries -- what are most important missing libs?
    1.  Is I/O fast enough?
    1.  Is networking solid enough?
1.  Platform support
    1.  Linux
    1.  Windows
    1.  macOS
    1.  Android -- later
    1.  iOS -- later
